# Advent of Code 2021

My Python solutions to the 2021 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). All solutions rely only on the standard Python library.

You can check out my [solutions for 2020 here](https://github.com/coocos/advent-of-code-2020).

## How to run the solutions

All the solutions are standalone Python scripts without any external dependencies. So for example to run the solution for day 22:

```
python aoc/day22/puzzle.py
```
